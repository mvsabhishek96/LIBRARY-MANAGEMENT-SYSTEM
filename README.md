# Library Management System

## Overview
The Library Management System is a Java-based application that simulates a library's functionality, allowing users to manage various items like books, journal articles, videos, and CDs. It provides features for checking items in and out, viewing item details, and adding copies for administrative management.

## Features
- View all library items (books, journal papers, videos, CDs)
- Check out items and update the number of available copies
- Check in items and restore the number of available copies
- Add copies of items for administrators

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Basic console input/output

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine (Java 8 or higher)
- An IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA (optional)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-system.git
2.Navigate to the Project Directory:
cd library-management-system
3.Open the Project in Your IDE:

If you're using Eclipse:
Open Eclipse and select File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace.
Browse to the project directory and select it.
Running the Application
  1.Compile the Java Files:
  2.Make sure all Java files are compiled without errors in your IDE.
  3.Run the Main Class:

Locate the LibraryManagementSystem class and run it as a Java application.
Interact with the Program:

Follow the on-screen prompts to view items, check them out, check them in, and add copies.

Code Structure
----------------
Item (Abstract Superclass): Defines common properties and methods for all library items.
WrittenItem (Abstract Subclass): Inherits from Item and adds properties related to written items.
Book and JournalPaper (Subclasses of WrittenItem): Specific implementations for books and journal articles.
MediaItem (Abstract Subclass): Inherits from Item and adds properties related to media items.
Video and CD (Subclasses of MediaItem): Specific implementations for videos and CDs.
LibraryManagementSystem (Main Class): Contains the main method and user interaction logic.
Future Improvements
--------------------
Implement a database for persistent storage of items.
Add user authentication for different roles (admin and user).
Enhance user interface using JavaFX or a web-based interface.
Implement search functionality for finding items by title or author.
